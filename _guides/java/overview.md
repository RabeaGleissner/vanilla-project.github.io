Java is a general-purpose programming language introduced little over 20 years ago.
It has become widely popular in the enterprise space due to the Java Virtual Machine, the Garbage Collector, a similar programming model to C/C++ and the promise of easier-to-write programs than its competitors of the time.

It is statically typed, notorious for a proliferation of `null`, and relies on polymorphism for clever solutions to problems.
Since Java 8, more and more functional programming elements have found their way into the language, such as `Stream` and `Optional<T>`, making a resurgence since the more traditional Java 6 and 7 releases.
