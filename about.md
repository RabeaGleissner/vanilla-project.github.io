New-language.guide is an attempt to ease out the learning curve when learning a new language.
We found we ask ourselves similar questions every time we start with an language.

- _&ldquo;How do I install the language runtime?&rdquo;_
- _&ldquo;How does a basic directory structure look like?&rdquo;_
- _&ldquo;What tools do I need to get started?&rdquo;_
- &hellip;

This is our attempt to help other people that might face similar struggles.

We do not provide tutorials on how to get started with a given language.
There are many great resources out there already, and we're linking to the ones we know.
If you think we're missing resources worth mentioning please don't hestitate to raise an issue or pull request on our <a href="https://github.com">github repository</a>.

The guides we provide are opiniated in the way we think a project _should_ be structured.
That doesn't mean it's the best way to structure a project but a way we've seen and implemented ourselves in the past.
